Algorithm to generate the time table for 4th and 6th sem

[Constraints]: - 1 teacher teaches 2 subjects(one to 4, one to 6)
- one teacher present at one class at a time
- design for before break classes only; 4 classes

= Declare TCMap DS which contains teacherId and class allocation at a given time
Initialiaze class allocation as flag = -1

= Declare two arrays of type TCMap
-> TCMap[] sem4;
-> TCMap[] sem6;

= Declare a hashmap(int, string) - store the taecher names against their teacher Id

= Define a printMap function to print the values of the TCMap
= Define a search function which searches for the teacherId in the input array

= Define a function permutation
-> arguments: 2; type: TCMap []
-> returns: int [][]
-> uses int [2][4] day array; Do the initialization
-> three pointers - i >> points to the list of teachers of sem4
->                - j >> points to the list of teachers of sem6
                  - ptr >> points to the day columns
-> sem4 is sorted (asc)
-> sem6 is sorted (desc)

== Functionality
Use a day array to arrange teachers in the classes for a single day
loop runs until ptr<4
i updates as i=(i+1)%sem4.length
j updates as j=(j+1)%sem6.length

# such that i remains looping in the list

$ for sem4 teachers list directly copy the teacherId to the day[0] and replace teacherId's flag with ptr (column where the teacher is allocated the class)
$ for sem6 some checking is required: copy the teacherId to the day[1] and replace teacherId's flag with ptr (colum where the teacher is allocated the class)
  after this search the sem4 list for the same teacherId; if got then return the it's flag value else return -999

= Define a TimeTable class
-> 2 matrices of size 5x4 === int[5][4] fouth; int[5][4] sixth; Do the initialization
  --> this matrix stores the time table for the whole week for fourth sem and sixth sem
-> dayLabel: indicates the day of the week

== Functionality
for eachLabel < 5; permutation function is called and the retured day array is copies as:
day[0] is copied to fourth[dayLabel]
day[1] is copied to sixth[dayLabel]

$ print the matrix to see the result
